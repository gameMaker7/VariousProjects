Dungeon Generator
	Center Core room
	side checks for room
	if checks true create new room
	Lmit creation zone
	begining monster spawns possible
	
	number of rooms possible 
		more rooms = better/more traps at start (based on time resources )
		more waves
		greater end score
	Types of rooms
		Corridor: Hallway which will connect rooms (possibly generated after rooms are built and not cosidered actual rooms)
		Basic Room: small room which will have one trap tile single lane of movement straight through room can only be connected straightway)
		Advanced Room: larger room which contains two trap tiles one of which can be upgraded into a large trap tile, connects in a L fasion might have two lanes of movement)
		Narrow Room: Simple bridge across a pit will have trap tiles or interactive obstacle based on time
		Workshop: medium room which contains one large trap tile (time based could produce energy for interactive obstacles or resources for upgrading traps) 
		Healing Room: will have one large trap tile can regenerate enemy health (based on time may be altered to allow player to revive core life)
		Monster Spawner: Player cannot create traps in this zone enemy monsters spawn here based on the number of spawners 
			enemies will spawn in greater numbers in spawners farther from core) ( based on time may be possible to prioritize spawners to funnel monsters into certain areas)
		Blockade: Large room which has two trap tiles and one large trap tile 
			(based on time this may become a interactive obstacle such as a slow spell(decrease speed of enemies within range),
			buff tower(increases effectiveness of other towers in range) or wall which enemies have to break)
		Empty Zone: This area hs no trap potential (based on time may be possible to create seals which enemies must destroy to attack core)
		Intersection: these rooms have a large trap tile and can lead to multiple possible channels (based on time may allow player to use these to change dungeon layout at game start)
		AutoSentry: Has no trap tiles but has a automatic trap which attacks enemies (Based on time may become interactive)
		
		Interactive: Energy based obstacles that can be activated with a limited duration based on mouse click or key press 
	Traps 
		Room slots vs Free place
		Max slots in each room
		traps have difrent sizes (normal, large)
		More traps each wave (or if time premits resources used to upgrade or buy traps) 
		Traps have area of effect ( getObjectsInRange(int radius, java.lang.Class cls))
		Traps deal instant kills with cooldown timers ( based on time and preferance may change to damage based)
		Based on time Traps have charges which will run out and cannot be repleneshed during waves bt can be restored during build phase 
		Upgrading trap slot is simply scaling slot image to a larger size
			traps check if size of image is normal or large based on the type of trap
		
		
	Monsters
		single type of enemies (possibly more based on time)
		Goblins are normal (first type)
		Wraiths are immune to physical traps
		Rats come in large swarms but stick together in clusters
		Stat increases vs more monsters each wave
		monsters reach core, do damage to core
		
	Bosses
		Powerful versions of normal monsters or capable of removing traps that are in cooldown

		
		
Priority
	generating dungeon which contains one core and at least one monster spawner 
	dungeon connects correctly 
	create system which allows enemies to walk through dungeon
	build system which will add trap tiles into monster walkway
	Create boss waves
	add score system
	--------------------------------
	Basic project finished
	--------------------------------
	decide if we use trap charge system
	decide if we will use resource system
	decide if we allow player construction of corridors
	Build empty zone seals
	decide if we will use energy system
		build blockade obstacle
		build narrow room obstacle
	 	build healing room systems
	 	build auto sentry systems
	Decide if we use other enemy types
		create other types of enemies or special versions of current monster type
	improve UI
		mouse over traps to get charges
		mouse over wave counter to get number of enemies left
		add various difficulties 
			more enemies
			less traps
			more cores one core death is still game over
		Make stand alone
